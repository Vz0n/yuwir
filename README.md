## Your Work in Rust

This is just a project that contains every code that i did on exams of programming in the C language. As i was way too easy, i decided to port every excersise to Rust and combine all in only one console program.

Probably i'll include excersises that are from other exams, just maybe. 

### Why you did this?

I was bored.

### Do you have plans to add something else

Besides colors and decoration, no.
